# ETH Token Deployment system 

## System Summary

**ERC20 Token Deployment & Management System**: A Telegram-based bot that enables users to deploy ERC20 tokens with automated liquidity pool creation and multi-wallet initial purchases. Users select from a curated contract store, configure multiple wallets for collaborative token distribution, and execute bundled transactions for seamless token launches with built-in management capabilities.

## System Components

**Telegram Bot Interface**

- Primary user interaction layer providing conversational flows for token deployment, wallet management, and system configuration

**Smart Contract Store**

- Repository for managing ERC20 contract templates with nicknames, descriptions, and metadata allowing users to select pre-configured contracts without repeated imports

**Wallet Management Service**

- Handles creation, import, storage, and export of multiple wallets per deployment; manages wallet configurations for collaborative token distribution and partnership allocations

**Transaction Bundling Engine**

- Orchestrates sequential execution of deployment transactions: contract deployment → liquidity pool creation → initial token purchases → parameter configuration, ensuring atomic execution order

**Configuration Persistence Layer**

- Stores and manages reusable wallet configurations and contract settings, enabling users to save deployment templates for future use

**Token Management System**

- Post-deployment management of deployed tokens and associated wallets, tracking token state and enabling ongoing wallet operations

**Liquidity Pool Integration**

- Uniswap V2 integration for automated liquidity pool creation and initial token purchase execution from configured wallets

This system enables collaborative token launches where users can distribute initial token allocations across multiple wallets and export specific wallets to partners while maintaining control over the deployment process.
